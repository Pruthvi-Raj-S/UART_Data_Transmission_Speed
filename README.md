# UART_Data_Transmission_Speed
This repository contains the firmware and PC-side application for demonstrating UART communication between a PC and a Microcontroller Unit (MCU). The project involves transmitting a text of approximately 1000 characters from the PC to the MCU via UART at a baud rate of 2400.
